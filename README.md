## About

This project has 2 main objectives:
1. Clinical purpose: As the most of mental disorders are not acute and lasting for several days, weeks, months or even years, it is highly important to monitor mental state (mood, sleep quality, psychotic features, cognitive functions, psychosomatic symptoms, etc) to manage the disorder effectively and prevent further relapses and deterioration. However, it becomes very difficult for many people that struggle with psychiatric conditions due to several reasons: they can forget about it, do not notice any changes or skip doctor's appointments. We propose that our Reminder-Bot can become a useful tool for these people, that helps people to keep mental state under their control.
2. Research: To date, neuropsychiatric disorders still lack objective knowledge for reliable diagnostic and treatment options. Thus, there is still a big field to conduct studies. With our app, we aim to investigate which behavioral and psychological markers may predispose to a relapse of a disease or mental retardation.
